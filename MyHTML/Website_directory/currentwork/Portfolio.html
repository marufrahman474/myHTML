      <font face="Verdana" font color="white" font size="5"> So far my current obsession is Crypto-currencies. Mainly Ethereum. After reading about Crypto Currencies over the summer, I've decided to learnup on Mining computers. These computers would work through a lot of code, and if they are able to crack them, they gain a currency called ETH.

      Previously, I had a 5 card mining system, however due to a dead power supply, I am now temporarly down to a 2 Card system. (Pictured)
