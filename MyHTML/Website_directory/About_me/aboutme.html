      <font face="Verdana" font color="white" font size="5"> Hi!, my name is Maruf Rahman. I have many different things that makes me unique, and I guess there would not be enough space or time for me to tell you my life story, so heres a summary:
      I've lived half my life in Canada and the other half of my life out in Bangladesh. I've studied Economics and Finance in North South University.
    </br>
    </br>
      I have a passion for both Busisness and Technology.    I've managed a small import and wholesale busisness of computers, servers and other electronics, back home and for the short period that I managed it, it went quite well.
</br>
</br>
       On the personal side of things, I personally love reading novels, building computers, and catching up on the news on the latest cars and technology.
       I have a soft spot in my heart for video games, and I'm currently on a Civilization 4 campaign.
     </br>
     </br>
       I also love learning about new things. Every few days I go on wikipedia for a few hours to read up on something new.  A few days ago I was obsessed reading about the Cold War and MKULTRA, and yesterday I was reading up about the future of Artifical intellegence.
     </br>
     </br>
I dont know a lot of things, but im always open on learning and expanding my knaawledge.
